# connecting a remote host loated in "Future City" Campus

1. Turn on the sshd 

a. How to check the status? Try: systemctl status sshd
b. How to start sshd if it's off? Try: systemctl start sshd (it would require root's permission)

2. Configure the IP 

Try: ifconfig 
Not sure about all details of the output, but generally inet would give you the HostName: 

ssh -AX winteryao@172.27.143.194 
(note: it seems that the ip configuration should be identical so it can be recognized, use CUG)

3. Enable sshd service while restarting/rebooting the machine? 

Try: systemctl enable sshd.service
