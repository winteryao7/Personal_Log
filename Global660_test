I played with a few things regarding the 660-interface 

1. A dataset from Huang et al. (2019) 

https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/21819

(as discussed with Prof. Tian, the absolute depth of the 660-interface would 
depends on corrections from the crustal and upper mantle velocity model)

2. SP12RTS (https://cube.rhul.ac.uk/~paulak/downloads_sp12rts.html)
tomographic model of both shear-wave and compressional-wave velocity variations in the mantle

A useful GMT5 plotting script provided by the authors. 

3. I generated a velocity variations at a depth of 660 km (the "interface")
mkmap 3 5 660 

map.660km.pdf (a map generated from Koelemeijer's script, originally from J. Ritsema) 
A depth slice at 660 km (I suppose it would be interpolated somehow, spline method)

map.pdf: 
each observation point (lon, lat, depth); then I obtain the depth slice based on the depth; 
find the closest 4 points to the obervation point, and calcculate the weighted average. 
Then I plot it out (~480 points; see the script)
