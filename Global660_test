I played with a few things regarding the 660-interface 

1. A dataset from Huang et al. (2019) 

https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/21819

(as discussed with Prof. Tian, the absolute depth of the 660-interface would 
depends on corrections from the crustal and upper mantle velocity model)

2. SP12RTS (https://cube.rhul.ac.uk/~paulak/downloads_sp12rts.html)
tomographic model of both shear-wave and compressional-wave velocity variations in the mantle

A useful GMT5 plotting script provided by the authors. 

3. I generated a velocity variations at a depth of 660 km (the "interface")
mkmap 3 5 660
